### Problem statement

In the world of startups and entrepreneurship, gaining access to high-quality feedback and mentorship is often a major hurdle, especially for founders at the early stages of their business journey. The inner circle of venture capital and expert guidance can feel closed off, creating a significant challenge for founders outside of traditional networks. Our initiative seeks to democratize access to expert business advice and give founders the opportunity to test their ideas, refine their pitches, and gain critical feedback -- regardless of who they know / how many connections they have, and conveniently from their phone or computer.

### Introduction

Hi everyone! We're excited to introduce our digital "Shark Tank" simulator. 

Our project uses AI to create interactive photorealistic agents of industry titans like Mark Cuban, Marc Andreessen, Paul Graham, and Sam Altman. This platform serves as a virtual venture capital feedback tool, offering founders a unique opportunity to present their business ideas anytime, anywhere.

Our goal is simple yet ambitious -- to provide every entrepreneur with a VC in their pocket. Users can pitch their startups to our digital panel, request funding, and engage in negotiations as if in a real-life pitch meeting. Following their pitch, users receive comprehensive feedback on various aspects of their business model and presentation, helping them to further refine their pitch and business strategy.
